## practising github
## initializing with git init
## now check status by git status and you can see that it is not commited
## now we will add it
## now we will check git branches
## by using commit we can make staging
## it is not compulsory to rename to main but we usually do
## now we will add url of git destination
## git remote -v will give furthur information
## now we will connect with github
## then push it 
## make another file app.py and main.py and add them
## to add multiple files at atime we only write git add .
## we can add a file at git hub and then pull it to origin main
## we dont add all the folders at github because of the high memory size
## then we will add it to .gitignore(DLL)
## for example we always create environments for our project but dont add them in the git because of liberaries involved
## environment setup is not working for the time being we will switch to next step
## now moving towards branching
